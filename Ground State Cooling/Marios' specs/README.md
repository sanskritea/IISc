This folder contains data and plots from trying to replicate [Marios' code](https://zenodo.org/record/3776468#.XueLKsBS82w), paper [here](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023335).<br.
I used a 3 level superconducting transmon with anharmonicity 300MHz with a 50 level oscillator scaled down for initial thermal occupation 0.05.<br>
The cooling became poorer with drive amplitude for lower coupling strengths.
